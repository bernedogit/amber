// If the NSA is able to run 10¹² tests per second (as suggested by Snowden),
// using a 12 character password still requires 6 days to crack and a 15
// character password takes 600 years. Remember that this is valid for random
// generated passwords only. It is not clear which kind of capabilities are
// available for password cracking. Scrypt tries to make it more expensive to
// crack the password by requiring not only compute time but also memory.
// However there is a trade off and it is possible to trade speed for
// memory. There are ASICs being offered to crack Scrypt, so 10¹² attempts
// per second seems to be achievable.



// PRNG according to NIST-800-90A. It generates a new block of random output
// by running the output of Chacha. It gets random bytes once at the
// constructor and then generates the random numbers without making any
// system calls. It hashes the random bytes obtained from the system, the
// current system time and the current value of the
// std::chrono::high_resolution_clock. The hash is keyed with the given
// password or key. The output of this random generator can be used to
// generate nonces and temporary keys. After each call to get_bytes() we
// reset the internal state. This prevents Mallory from recovering past
// outputs of the random number generator.

// If the bytes returned by the system's random number generator are random
// then the output of Keyed_random is also random. If system's source of
// random bytes fails to produce random bytes then the output of Keyed_random
// can still be used as a nonce because it is keyed with the system clock
// and the high resolution clock. As long as you do not adjust your clock
// backwards it is likely that the nonces will not repeat. If the password
// or key that you pass is secret and unpredictable then the stream generated
// by Keyed_random key will be unpredictable without knowing the password,
// even if the system's random number generator fails.

// Note that this class is not thread safe and not fork safe. If you share an
// instance of Keyed_random among different threads you must provide your own
// locking. Also if a process forks then the child process will inherit the
// state of the parent and both will produce the same sequence of random
// bytes.

// This class generates chunks of 64 bytes of random sequence. If a call does
// not completely consume the last block then it will be kept for the next
// call. No attempt is done to provide for forward security by overwriting
// the internal buffer or internal state. Instead the focus is on efficiency
// even if very small amounts of output are requested at each time.
